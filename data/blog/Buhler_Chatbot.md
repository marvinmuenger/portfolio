## Introduction

Nowadays, chatbots are becoming more and more advanced, with some even able to hold full conversations with humans. Back when I did my internship at B端hler Group, chatbots were not as sophisticated or as common, but I was given the opportunity to create one for the company. Using Azure Bot Services and Python, I developed a tool that could answer questions about the company's documentation and keep itself up-to-date with the latest information.

## Designing and Building the Chatbot

I began my project by analyzing the types of questions that employees might have and identifying the key features that the chatbot would need. After testing various tools, I decided to use Azure Bot Services to build a chatbot that could understand and respond to a wide range of queries. I also used Angular to build the chatbot's frontend.

## Ensuring Accuracy and Relevance with a DevOps Pipeline

To make sure the chatbot's database was always up-to-date with the latest information, I created a Python script that would automatically update the database and built a DevOps pipeline around it. This ensured that the chatbot was always able to provide accurate and relevant answers to users.

## The Impact of the Chatbot

The chatbot I developed had a significant impact on the company's operations. It made it easier for employees to access the information they needed, and saved them time that would have been spent searching through lengthy documents. This allowed them to focus on their work and improve the company's productivity.

## Conclusion

Overall, my experience developing a chatbot at B端hler Group was an incredibly rewarding one. Not only did I get to work on an innovative project that had a tangible impact on the company's operations, but I also learned a lot about chatbot development and how they can be used to improve the user experience.

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work independently on this project and to have the support of the team at B端hler Group. It was a challenging and enriching experience that has helped me grow both personally and professionally.

If you have any questions about the project or would like to learn more about chatbot development, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
